# Django Bootcamp - Ailaysa Technologies Private Limited

You taught the basics of the Django framework and guided us through a simple project called "movie_portal". This helped us understand how to start a project and run it using Django commands.

Now, I am working on a backend project called Library Management System using the Django framework. I share my daily activities and project progress on GitHub to keep track of how the project is going.
