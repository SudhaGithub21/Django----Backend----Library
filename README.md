# Django Bootcamp - Ailaysa Technologies Private Limited

"Ailaysa" is a collaborative platform for project management, managing linguistic assets, team coordination, assignment tracking, and integration. I learned a lot about your company's workflows, which I found very interesting. Your focus on a generative AI platform for creating multilingual and multi-modal content is impressive. You cover many aspects of content,including translation, creation, transformation, and discovery.

You taught the basics of the Django framework and guided us through a simple project called "movie_portal". This helped us understand how to start a project and run it using Django commands.

Now, I am working on a backend project called Library Management System using the Django framework. I share my daily activities and project progress on GitHub to keep track of how the project is going.
